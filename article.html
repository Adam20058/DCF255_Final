            <h2>Communication on the Internet</h2>
            <p>
              In a pre-internet world, the physical act of sending mail involved
              quite a few steps and depended on the proper functioning of many
              interconnected postal and transportation systems. On the
              receivers’ end, a positive or negative emotional response would
              depend on the contents of the letter or package. A letter from a
              friend was a pleasant surprise, but the incessant marketing emails
              from a credit card company would not necessarily feel as good.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Today those marketing messages still exist, as do the messages
              from friends. However, the way we send these has changed quite
              drastically. Although we still do depend on physical mail quite a
              bit, the reality is that most communication is conducted via
              email. Many white-collar jobs are essentially just a series of
              emails sent back and forth! The fact that this form of mail is
              electronic does not change the fact that there is still a complex
              infrastructure behind it that enables its smooth operation. Email
              is just one function of the connected internet that is governed by
              certain standard communication protocols.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2 id="paragraph-2">Why Have Standards?</h2>
            <p>
              Sending and receiving messages across a network is not a trivial
              problem to solve. Essentially, a computer can only really send
              electronic signals either in an analog or digital format.
              Consequently, the receiver must accept those signals and decipher
              them and evaluate what the intended message was. As such, it
              becomes quite important to establish standards so that data is
              sent in a way such that the intention becomes clear and so that
              the receiver’s job also becomes a simpler task. In addition to the
              format of the data to be sent and received, the idea of the sender
              and the receiver themselves is quite important. That is, how does
              one node in a network know where to send its data and how does a
              receiver evaluate where the data it is receiving has come from?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              These are two problems that communication protocols are designed
              to solve for and as such, protocols for all kinds of processes
              have evolved over time. Today the most common protocol stack that
              we use is called the Internet Protocol Suite, commonly referred to
              as TCP/IP. This stack was derived from two foundational protocols,
              the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol
              (Socolofsky & Kale, Internet Society: RFC, 1991). The TCP/IP model
              includes protocols that govern all the layers of the internet from
              the application level all the way down to the physical level. The
              scope of this paper is not to examine and define all of these
              levels. What we will be doing is exploring one specific protocol.
            </p>
            <h2 id="paragraph-3">SMTP</h2>
            <p>
              Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or SMTP is one of the most common
              standards for sending and receiving emails on the modern internet;
              however, SMTP is not new and has existed in some form or the other
              for close to 40 years. A predecessor to what we know as SMTP today
              was simply MTP or Mail Transfer Protocol (Kozierok, 2005). This
              early protocol, the MTP, was essentially an amalgamation of two
              pre-existing protocols; Telnet and FTP. What MTP did was combine
              these two protocols in what could today be considered a ‘hacky’
              way. The result was a protocol that was restricted by its parent
              protocols. FTP is a general file transfer protocol and as such
              features that were desired in email would not necessarily transfer
              over as easily (Kozierok, 2005). SMTP was developed in time to
              create a new protocol for emails. The ‘S’ in SMTP indicates that
              this new option is simpler than the ‘hacky’ MTP it is taking over
              from. What it really means is that this new protocol is built from
              the ground up to manage emails in a way that MTP really wasn’t and
              as such, it is more suited for the job.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2 id="paragraph-4">how does it work</h2>
            <p>
              RFC 821 defines the SMTP protocol and proposes this diagram for
              its implementation:
            </p>
            <img src="./img/diagrams/smtp-model.png" alt="" />
            <br />
            <p>
              As per this diagram we see that both, the sender and the receiver,
              are governed and controlled by SMTP servers. The sender therefore,
              would send their message the the ‘Sender SMTP Server’. This server
              then is in charge of handling where to forward this message. In
              the early days of the internet, before the advent of what we call
              Domain Name Servers (DNS), there was no way to map which server
              was managing which IP addresses. At this time SMTP relied on
              ‘relaying’, which meant that a sequence of SMTP routes was relayed
              along with the initial message. This routing allowed the message
              to be ‘relayed’ from one server to another till it reached its
              destination (Kozierok, 2005). Today with DNS implemented, the
              sender server can make a DNS lookup request, acquire the receivers
              IP address, and send the payload directly to the receiver. Once
              the lookup request resolves, the sender establishes a connection
              with the receiver and mail transactions can occur once this is
              completed. Finally the session is terminated. So how does it all
              work? In this following diagram we see how the servers communicate
              with one another:
            </p>
            <br />
            <img src="./img/diagrams/smtp-architecture.png" alt="" />
            <br />
            <p>
              The EHLO and HELO commands are SMTP specific commands that
              identify the servers to one another. That is, they allow the
              connection to be established. HELO was the original command and
              EHLO was created later to allow the addition of new
              functionalities that were developed for the protocol.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              For the above architecture to function correctly, SMTP servers
              must be left running 24/7 in order to listen for the appropriate
              TCP messages. This is not necessarily feasible for many end-users
              which results it the use of other protocols such as POP3 or IMAP
              to complete the transmission on the clients’ machine. Professional
              email services set up SMTP servers that their users can use and as
              such, the cognitive and technical load is not passed down to the
              user. The user logs in, sends a message, and a receiver will
              receive that message. In between, all the SMTP work is handled by
              the provider. So if we use Gmail as an example, once the
              receivers’ SMTP server receives the email, Gmail retrieves the
              email via either POP3, IMAP, or a proprietary solution and
              forwards it to the users’ inbox.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2 id="paragraph-5">TLDR:</h2>
            <p>
              SMTP is used to send emails to an SMTP server, then forward that
              email from one SMTP server to another, and then receive that email
              safely. It is up to the user’s client to retrieve the email from
              the SMTP server, and this is done via POP3 or IMAP in most cases.
              These days the user has limited to no visibility into any of these
              steps; however, not so long ago, the user was responsible for
              setting up their POP3 or IMAP settings in their email client and
              emails could be synched between the client application and their
              SMTP server upon logging in.
