            <h2 id="demo-1">Gmail Demonstration</h2>
            <p>
              Utilizing the popular programming language Python, we can program
              a script which allows us to view the mechanics of how an email is
              sent using SMTP. For this example, we will be using the Gmail SMTP
              server to send an email from our script, right to our Gmail inbox.
              Within Python, we will be using the built-in library smtplib, to
              send basic emails. This library contains all the SMTP related
              functions that allow us to connect with a SMTP server as well as
              encrypt the emails in order to accommodate Gmail’s security
              features.
            </p>
            <br />
            <img
              style="border-radius: 5px"
              frameBorder="0"
              src="../img/demo/gmail_demo.gif"
              alt="gmail demo done by Lucas"
            />
            <br />
            <p>
              To begin the script, we define a few variables to hold
              information. We utilize a port variable to hold the integer 465,
              which corresponds to the Gmail SMTP port. We then define both a
              sender and receiver email which for this example, must end in
              @gmail.com. Then we define a message variable to contain the
              contents of what we want our email to include. Lastly, we define a
              variable context to create a SSL certificate to ensure a secure
              connection to the Gmail SMTP server.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once all variables are defined, we move onto creating the
              connection to the SMTP server using the smptlib function
              SMTP_SLL(). This function creates the TLS certificate connection
              from our local machine to the Gmail SMTP servers. Using the
              smtp.gmal.com server name, port number, and context that was
              previously defined we are able to establish a secure connection to
              the Gmail SMTP servers. As Gmail is a password protected email
              service, we need to prompt the user for the password to their
              Gmail account in order to grant access to the Email services
              provided by Gmail. Upon successful login, we utilize the
              sendmail() function to send the email through the Gmail services,
              and from there Gmail processes the email through their SMTP
              servers and into the inbox of the receiver.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a surface level example to how email services function
              once the “send” button is pushed. Behind the scenes of this, each
              email provider has their own SMTP server to route all inbound and
              outbound emails to their corresponding email provider and
              receiver.
            </p>

            <!-- demo 2 -->
            <h2 id="demo-2">Local Host Demonstration</h2>
            <br />
            <img
              style="border-radius: 5px"
              frameBorder="0"
              src="../img/demo/localHost_demo.gif"
              alt="gmail demo done by Lucas"
            />
            <br />
            <p>
              Like the previous example of how SMTP functions when using Gmail,
              we are also able to use an alternate version locally on a user’s
              pc. We are able to take advantage of using Pythons SMTP debugging
              server to allow us to communicate with a locally hosted server to
              practice or test SMTP functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to begin, we must first run the debugging server locally
              by using the command “Python -m smtpd -c DebuggingServer -n
              localhost:1025” in the user’s shell of choice. This will turn that
              specific shells session into the Python SMTP debugging server and
              will stay actively opening listening for any inbound connections.
            </p>
            <p>
              The script itself is similar to the Gmail example, but omits the
              need for a SMTP address, and user login. Two noticeable
              differences are the variables port and server. The port number is
              changes to 1025, a unused port number we can assign to our
              localhost server. The server variable is declared as “localhost”
              as we are using our current machine to host the SMTP server. We
              utilize the same function of SMPT() to build a connection to the
              debugging server by using the variables server and port. Since we
              are using a local server for practice, we omit the use of
              SMTP_SLL() as we do not require a secured connection. Since our
              debugging server is waiting listening for a connection, once the
              server.sendmail() function is passed our debugging server listens
              to the connection and displays the email within the console.
            </p>
            <p>
              The purpose of a debugging server allows you to practice your
              script without suffering any severe consequences when connecting
              to an email providers SMTP server. Additionally, all messages sent
              are only being displayed as output and are removed after.
