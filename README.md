- This started as a simple written report on Simple Mail Transfer Protocols for my Data Communications Fundamentals course that I took during the Winter of 2021.
- In the end I ended up making an informational website instead in order to explain the topic.

- In this cool group project me and my 2 other group members (Omar and Lucas) also demonstrated the SMTP protocol by utilizing python.
